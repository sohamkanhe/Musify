## How to Run Locally

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    Clone this project to your local machine using `git clone`.

2.  **Add Your Music and Covers**
    -   Place your `.mp3` audio files inside the `/songs` folder.
    -   Place your `.jpg` cover images inside the `/covers` folder.
    -   **Important:** The names of the audio and image files must exactly match the `name` property for each song in the `script.js` file.

3.  **Verify Asset Paths**
    The paths for SVGs and other images are set to be relative (e.g., `/Users/musify/img/home.svg`). If any are not loading, you may need to modify the `src` paths in the `index.html` file to match your file locations.

4.  **Launch the Application**
    Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to start using Musify.
